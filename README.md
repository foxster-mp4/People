UIKit Practice Project #10 â€“ Simple app to store names along with photos of people you've met

### Cool Features
* Light & dark mode support
* Responsive layout that works and looks great on iPhones and iPads
* Simple, Apple-esque appearance (launch screen, information screens, user-input retrieval screen, etc.)

### Known Issues
* ~~New data is not retained after app restart~~ (resolved in [5ada455](https://github.com/foxster-mp4/People/commit/5ada4550426429e293a54aa7a59a71eaead9b22f))
* Image picker shows up blank on Simulator devices (16.0, 20A5283p); likely to be a Simulator issue according to a few forum discussions but it's still worth mentioning

### TODOs
* Resolve known issues
* Add Dynamic Type support
